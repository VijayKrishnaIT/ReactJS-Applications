        - we will develop reactjs applications in 2 ways

                1) JSX

                2) Typescript

        - JSX Stands for Javascript and XML

        - Typescript is the Programming Language

        - JSX won't support the OOPS.

        - Typescript supports the OOPS(inheritance , polymorphism --> reusability).

        - if we build React JS applications with Typescript automatically we are gettings OOPS Benefits.

        - Browsers can't understand XML.

        - So as a developer we should convert XML to equivalent Javascript

        - Babel is in built tool of react.

        - React JS applications are Component Based Application.
